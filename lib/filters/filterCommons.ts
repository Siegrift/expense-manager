 * Implement arbitrary filter logic in this function. You recieve all
 * expense manager data (readonly) as an object passed in the first
 * parameter. The objects consists of the following fileds:
 * 1) transactions (array)
 * 2) tags (array)
 * 3) profile (object)
 * 
 * The returned state should match the shape of the expense manager data
 * passed as an argument. The code must be synchronous.
 * 
 * WARNING: There are no heavy implemented when running the filters, 
 * meaning that it is possible wrong implementation of a filter will
 * cause the app to crash. Be careful!
 * 
 * Developer choices and tips:
 * 1)   No library functions available - Passing built in functions like
 *      lodash or date-fns would increase the bundle size, as they would
 *      need to be included in all of screens (as filters are feature
 *      across all screens) 
 * 2)   Code must be synchronous - Async code would complicate this feature
 *      even more.
 * 3)   Use console.log and devtools to debug
 * 4)   You can run the code on current data and see the (serialized) 
 *      output below the editor. If there is an error, you will see the 
 *      serialized error.
